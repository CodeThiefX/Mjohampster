          Today marks an exciting milestone as we prepare to launch MJOHampter Coin ($MJOHami),
a cryptocurrency tailored for our dedicated DayZ community members. <br><br>
 
Here's what you need to know!<br><br>

Liquidity Pool Allocation:<br><br>

To ensure stability and liquidity, 40% of the total coin supply,
along with Ä4000 of my personal funds, will be locked in a liquidity pool. 
This reserve acts as a backbone, providing a solid foundation for the coin's value 
and facilitating smoother transactions within our ecosystem.<br><br>


Distribution to Active Members:<br><br>

Recognizing the value of our community's engagement, 
10% of the total coin supply will be shared among our active players and staff members.
This allocation serves as a token of appreciation for their ongoing dedication 
and involvement in our community endeavors.<br><br>


Founder's Reserve:<br><br>

A significant portion, 50% of the total coin supply, 
will be designated as the founder's reserve. 
These funds will be earmarked for essential purposes such as marketing efforts, 
community initiatives, and support for select family members. 
Importantly, I want to emphasize my commitment to the prudent management of this reserve. 
I pledge not to sell any bigger portion of the founder's reserve until 
the market conditions are stable and can sustain bigger transactions. 
This ensures the responsible utilization of resources 
for the long-term benefit of our community and the sustained growth of MJOHampterCoin.<br><br>


Transaction Fees:<br><br>

In alignment with our community-centric approach, 
there will be no transaction fees. 
This decision reflects our commitment to empowering our community members 
and facilitating seamless interactions within our ecosystem.<br><br>


Transparency and Trust:<br><br>

In an environment where trust is paramount, 
I am fully committed to maintaining transparency throughout this journey. 
I assure you that MJOHampterCoin stands apart from common crypto pitfalls like scams and rug pulls. 
With your support, let's build a cryptocurrency that truly embodies the values of transparency and longevity. 
Join us on Telegram, Discord, and Instagram to embark on this exciting journey and unlock the full potential 
of MJOHampterCoin! <br><br>


With heartfelt regards from the Mutated Jurassic Outbrake DayZ community, much love<br><br>
